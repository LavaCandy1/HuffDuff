# HuffDuff

HuffDuff is a campus navigation system that implements the A* pathfinding algorithm in Java to calculate and display the shortest route to various locations. The project features a web-based user interface for input and visualizes the optimal path on a 2D map of a campus floor, enhancing student navigation and punctuality.

## Key Features

*   **A\* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Efficiently calculates the shortest path from a fixed starting point to a user-selected destination, navigating around predefined obstacles.
*   **Interactive Web Interface**: A dynamic front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to easily input their desired block, room type, and room code.
*   **Dynamic Route Visualization**: The calculated path is rendered on an HTML canvas, providing a clear visual representation of the route overlaid on the campus map image.
*   **Database Integration**: Classroom and location coordinates are retrieved from a MySQL database, making the location data scalable and easy to manage.
*   **Java Servlet Backend**: The backend is built with Jakarta Servlets to handle HTTP requests, process user input, and serve the dynamic results page.

## How It Works

1.  A user accesses the main page (`index.html`) and enters their destination details (Block, Room Type, Room Code) into the form.
2.  The form submits the data to the `input` servlet.
3.  The servlet uses the `classCoordinateFinder` class to query a MySQL database for the grid coordinates corresponding to the requested location.
4.  The coordinates are passed to the `DemoClass`, which contains the A* algorithm implementation. The campus map is modeled as a 2D grid of `Node` objects.
5.  The A* algorithm calculates the most optimal path, avoiding nodes designated as walls.
6.  The `input` servlet dynamically generates an HTML response, embedding the calculated path coordinates into a JavaScript variable.
7.  On the client side, the JavaScript uses the coordinates to draw the path on an HTML canvas, visually guiding the user.

## Technologies Used

-   **Backend**: Java, Jakarta Servlets
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-   **Database**: MySQL, JDBC
-   **Pathfinding**: A* Algorithm

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Apache Tomcat (or equivalent) servlet container
- MySQL Server

### 1. Database Setup
1.  Create a MySQL database named `huffduff`.
2.  Within the database, create a table to store location coordinates. For example:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE bfirstfloor (
        name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        xCoord INT,
        yCoord INT
    );
    ```
3.  Populate this table with the names and coordinates of the locations on your map. The `name` should correspond to the format generated by the application (e.g., "303BLA").
4.  Update the database credentials (username and password) in `src/main/java/com/HuffDuff/classCoordinateFinder.java`:
    ```java
    // ... inside classCoordinateFinder.java
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/huffduff", "your-username", "your-password");
    ```

### 2. Deployment
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LavaCandy1/HuffDuff.git
    ```
2.  Build the project into a `.war` file using a tool like Maven or Eclipse.
3.  Deploy the generated `.war` file to your servlet container (e.g., by copying it to the `webapps` directory in Apache Tomcat).

### 3. Running the Application
1.  Start your Apache Tomcat server.
2.  Open a web browser and navigate to the application's main page (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/HuffDuff/index.html`).
3.  Select the Block, Room Type, and enter the Room Code for your destination.
4.  Click the "Search" button to see the shortest path displayed on the map.
